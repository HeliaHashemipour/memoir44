Memoir 44 game is a game in the sub-strategy in which the sums of World War II operations are simulated. Operations such as El Paul Piasus and the Anilisi forces or the liberation of Paris. In each scenario, one of the players is in the role of Axis and Diiri is in the role of Allied, and both players must try to achieve the victory of that scenario. Now what we want from you is to implement the scenario of the game. The way of the game is that in each round, a number of cards and forces are given to the players and the players execute the mechanism in each turn.
